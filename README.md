# Solar Tracker with Temperature Monitor

## Background
Solar panel operates at specific temperature with 15°C - 35°C being the optimal temperature with high efficiency rate. Lower temperatures do not cause problem since it operates just as good and even better in colder region, however, high temperature can reduce its efficiency, with 88°C being the point of decline. Due to said problem, this solar tracker is built with a temperature monitor in order to keep the solar panelefficient and prevent it from overheating.


## Description
Solar tracker with built-in temperature monitor to prevent overheating and keep the solar panel to stay at the desired operating region.
