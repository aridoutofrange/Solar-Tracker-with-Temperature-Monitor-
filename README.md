# Solar Tracker with Temperature Monitor

## Background
Solar panel operates at specific temperatures with 15°C - 35°C being the optimal temperatures with high efficiency rate. Lower temperatures do not cause problem since it operates just as good and even better in colder regions, however, high temperatures can reduce its efficiency, with 88°C being the point of decline. Due to said problem, this solar tracker is built with a temperature monitor in order to keep the solar panel's efficiency and prevent it from overheating.


## Description
Solar tracker with built-in temperature monitor to prevent overheating and keep the solar panel to stay at the desired operating region.
